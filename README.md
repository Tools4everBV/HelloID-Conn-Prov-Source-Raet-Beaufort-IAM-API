## Getting started
### App within Visma
First an App will have to be created in the [Visma Developer portal](https://oauth.developers.visma.com). This App can then be linked to specific scopes and to a client, which will only be available after the invitation has been accepted. 
Please follow the [Visma documentation on how to register the App and grant access to client data](https://community.visma.com/t5/Kennisbank-Youforce-API/Visma-Developer-portal-een-account-aanmaken-applicatie/ta-p/527059).

### Scope Configuration within Visma 
Before the connector can be used to retrieve employee information, the following scopes need to be enabled and assigned to the connector. If you need help setting the scopes up, please consult your Visma contact.

- Youforce-IAM:Get_Basic
- Youforce-Extensions:files:Get_Basic

> Note: When using any of the target connectors, additional scopes are required as well.
>   - For [HelloID-Conn-Prov-Target-RAET-IAM-API](https://github.com/Tools4everBV/HelloID-Conn-Prov-Target-RAET-IAM-API), used to write back the identity field, which is used for SSO, in Youforce, the following scopes are required:
>     - Youforce-IAM:Update_Identity 
>   - For [HelloID-Conn-Prov-Target-Raet-DPIA100-FileAPI](https://github.com/Tools4everBV/HelloID-Conn-Prov-Target-Raet-DPIA100-FileAPI), used to write back the data to Beaufort, e.g. the business email address, the following scopes are required:
>     - youforce-fileapi:files:list 
>     - youforce-fileapi:files:upload

### Connection settings
The following settings are required to run the source import.

### Prerequisites
 - Authorized Raet Developers account in order to request and receive the API credentials. See: https://developers.youforce.com. Make sure your client does the IAM API access request themselves on behalf of your own Raet Developers account (don't use Tools4ever, but your own developer account). More info about Raet Developers Portal: https://youtu.be/M9RHvm_KMh0
- ClientID, ClientSecret and tenantID to authenticate with RAET IAM-API Webservice

### Remarks
 - Currently, not all fields are available for HR Core Beaufort customers. For example: company.

### Mappings
A basic mapping is provided. Make sure to further customize these accordingly.
Please choose the default mappingset to use with the configured configuration.

When using only employments (not including assignments):
- mapping.employments.json
This mapping only uses fields available on employments and does not expect fields which would be available on the assignments.

When including assigments and excluding persons without contracts in HelloID (default setting):
- mapping.assignments.json
This mapping only uses fields available on assignments and does not expect fields which would be available on the assignments.
If a person has no assignments, this will result in an import error. To solve this (without changing the mapping) select the option to "**Exclude persons without contracts in HelloID**".

When including assigments and not excluding persons without contracts in HelloID:
- mapping.assignments.includePersonsWithoutAssignments.json
This mapping uses fields available on assignments, if these are not available for a person it uses the fields available on the employments.
If a person has no assignments & employments, this will result in an import error. To solve this (without changing the mapping) select the option to "**Exclude persons without contracts in HelloID**".

### Scope
The data collection retrieved by the queries is a default set which is sufficient for HelloID to provision persons.
The queries can be changed by the customer itself to meet their requirements.
